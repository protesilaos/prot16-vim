## About this repo

The Prot16 collection was initially developed for the Atom text editor. This repository contains preliminary/experimental ports for Vim. Support is provided both for GUI and terminal versions. 

However, the latter requires the implementation of the corresponding palette. This can be done either manually or by using one of the existing ports, as defined in each theme's project page. For more on that refer to the following:

- Prot16 project pages: https://protesilaos.com/schemes
- Prot16 main git repo: https://github.com/protesilaos/prot16

## Miscelleneous

The files included in this repository were generated by the [Prot16 Builder](https://github.com/protesilaos/prot16-builder). A simple bash script was used to automate the process.
